Project Overview
This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze revenue performance, occupancy trends, and operational metrics across multiple properties in the hospitality sector. The dashboard provides actionable insights for optimizing revenue management, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following primary KPIs:

Total Revenue: Overall revenue generated across all properties (1.71 billion)

Occupancy %: Average occupancy rate (57.9%)

Realisation %: Booking realization rate (70.1%)

RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Average revenue per room (7,747)

ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average room rate (12,096)

Features
1. Interactive Filter Panel
Allows users to filter data by:

City (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore)

Room Type

Category

2. Revenue & Occupancy Analysis
Revenue Breakdown: Total revenue and growth trends (e.g., 31.7% increase)

Occupancy Trends: Highlights properties with high/low occupancy rates (e.g., Atiq Palace Mumbai at 66.4%)

Revenue by Category: Distribution of revenue across segments (38.39% vs. 61.61%)

3. Property Performance Metrics
Detailed metrics for each property, including:

Revenue, Total Bookings, RevPAR, ADR, DSRN (Daily Settable Room Nights), DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights), DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)

4. Comparative Analysis
City-wise Performance: Mumbai properties (e.g., Atiq Evoica) show higher RevPAR (10,640) compared to Hyderabad (6,221).

Realisation % Consistency: Most properties maintain a realization rate of ~70%, indicating efficient booking conversions.

Insights & Conclusions
Top-Performing Property: Atiq Evoica Mumbai leads in revenue (118M) and RevPAR (10,640).

Occupancy Consistency: Most properties maintain ~65-66% occupancy, except Bangaloreâ€™s Atiq Evoica (53.8%), suggesting potential for improvement.

Revenue Drivers: Higher ADR in Mumbai (16,142) correlates with stronger revenue performance.

Operational Efficiency: Realisation % is stable across properties (~70%), indicating effective booking management.
